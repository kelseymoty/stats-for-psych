I think of this as drivers ed for statistics. Most of you wont end up being researchers or statisticians in the same way that most of you wont end up being auto mechanics or engineers for GM. You still benefit from knowing what a car is and how to operate it. Similarly, you will benefit from knowing what statistics is and a little bit about how to use it. For those of you who do want to go on to use statistics professionally, this will give you a strong foundation. By the end of the class, you will be able to: Recognize different kinds of variables and data. Understand most standard charts and graphs. Read and understand statistical reports. Conduct basic analyses of your own using statistical software. 1.4 Textbooks Were going to use a couple of different textbooks. All are optional but also free and useful, so I gotta suggest, take a look. Cohen, B.H. (2013). Explaining Psychological Statistics (4th Ed). Wiley.  This textbook is freely available through NYU. Click this link &gt; then click Download Book. Youll need to create a quick ProQuest account (name/email/pw) and download Adobe Digital Editions, which are both free. R for Data Science  Its free! Its online! It will teach you R! Good if you want to learn how to code or are interested in data science. Learning Statistics with R and Learning Statistics with JASP  Also free and online! They will teach you R and JASP! Extra points for the engaging way in which Danielle Navarro writes. 1.4.1 Statistical Software Note that part of the class will be learning to use statistical software for data analysis. Specifically, R and JASP. JASP is available for free download here. If you plan to use R, you will want to download R as well as RStudio; both are free. Alternatively, you can make a free RStudio Cloud account to get started with R. Using the cloud version ensures that everything has been properly installed and youll have no issues when trying to load packages. We will be teaching these skills (using R and JASP) in the class. However, if you find that you need extra assistance (particularly in learning R / they dont appear to have support for JASP), Bobst library provides software-specific tutorials as well as statistical consultants who are familiar with R. For more details, see their website. 1.5 Assignments 1.5.1 Exams (50%, using only your highest exam grade) Rather than multiple exams that cover different portions of the material, you will take a final exam at the end of every week. The exams will have nearly identical formats, differing only in the particulars. All exams are final exams, meaning they cover all of the material covered in the whole course. This means you will have a final exam at the end of Week 1, at the end of Week 2, at the end of Week 3, and so on Since these are all final exams, most of you probably wont do very well on the first exam. But thats ok, because: Your exam grade will be entirely based on your best exam. Other exam grades will not contribute at all. If you get a 90% on the third final, it doesnt matter how you did on the first two. This format has some very specific benefits: Low Anxiety: Students who are able to get a good grade on one of the early tests will be able to worry about things other than cramming for the next test. Safety Net: Each exam offers a new chance to set a minimum threshold for your grade. Once you get a 85 on one exam, you can rest easy that your grade wont go any lower. Transparency: No more need for, what will be on the test? Once you have taken the first final, you will know (approximately) the format of all the other finals. Context: Seeing all the material at once will allow you to begin building a tapestry of ideas in your head. You will never be blindsided by new material you are expected to know. Once youve seen one final exam you will have a good sense of all of them. Being exposed to all the material early on will help you learn it later. Good Incentives: I want to reward you if you fully understand the material quickly. Students who succeed will be rewarded with more freedom. No one who has mastered the material should be forced to go through the motions. If you get a grade youre happy with, you can choose to skip the rest of the exams with no downside. Feedback: You will be able to tell what skills you have mastered and which you need to work on. This will allow you to spend your study time wisely. Exams will be run through the survey software Qualtrics. You will have 45 minutes to complete the exam after the survey has been opened, so please be sure to not start the exam until you are able to complete the whole exam. These exams are open note, but must be completed by yourself (no working on exams with other people!). 1.5.2 Data Exploration (30%, 15% per research report) This is an opportunity for you to gain some experience conducting analyses on your own. In a folder on the Classes website there are a number of text files and matching csv files (a spreadsheet filetype). Each text file describes a (hypothetical) scenario, and the matching .csv includes the related data. For a research report, you pick a dataset and conduct the appropriate analyses on it with the statistical software of your choice (or by hand if you really want to, I guess). In this class, we will be covering how to use R and JASP, but you are free to use other software if you wish. You will not be told exactly which test(s) to run. Instead, you will determine this for yourself based on the scenario in the text file. The end product should be a document in which you describe the analyses you conducted, report the test results, and draw reasonable conclusions. The report has the following requirements: One page long. Longer submissions wont be accepted. I want you to learn to be concise! Twelve point font, 1.5-line spacing. Report your statistical analyses in (approximately) APA format. We need to be able to understand it, but formatting isnt the point of the assignment. Some sort of graph or plot Discuss, at least briefly, your conclusions: say what the test results mean for the (hypothetical) study. Also mention if you notice anything strange or have any concerns about the results. When you are done with a report, submit as a PDF on Brightspace to receive a grade. You are required to do two of these research reports at some point during the class. You can do these two reports at any point during the class, but since you wont be taught how to do most analyses until about halfway through, most of you will probably want to do these assignments during the second half of the course. If you are not satisfied with your grade on one or both of your research reports, you may do a replacement research report on a new dataset. You can only do a replacement report once for each research report. We want you to be able to learn from your mistakes but also I dont want you each doing 10 of these. Essentially this means you can do up to four of these and your grade will be based on your best two. Obviously if youre happy with your first two, you dont need to do four. Please dont complete more than 4, the extras wont be graded. 1.5.3 Participation (20%) Measuring participation in an online class that doesnt require attendance is a bit tricky, but I also hope that you will also be actively engaging with the material as it is presented. The best way I can measure participation (at least in my opinion) given these constraints is having you submit a short reflection of what was discussed in lecture that day. What should these reflections be about? Really anything. Maybe theres a topic that wasnt clear to you and would like some clarification on it. Maybe you found a connection between something we discussed today and something we addressed in a previous lecture. Maybe you found something interesting and want more details about it. Or maybe you want to provide some constructive feedback in how I presented something. Ill also ask a number of questions during lecture to encourage participation (and may provide some questions as prompts in the reflection submission box). You can write a response to one of these questions in your reflection if you cant think of anything else. What should these reflections look like? Nothing too formal and nothing particularly long. I dont want to put a specific minimum or maximum length because in the end, I see these reflections as an opportunity for myself to gauge where everyone is with the material (am I going too fast or too slow, etc.). A 2- to 4-sentence paragraph is generally an appropriate length. You wont be graded on grammar (incomplete sentences are ok); as long as a I can easily figure out what you are talking about, youre good. When are these due? Within 36 hours after the lecture ends, but Id recommend submitting these immediately after you watched/attended lecture. Im giving a little extra time for you to complete these for a couple of reasons: Some of you are watching these lectures after the fact, so I want there to be enough time for the lecture to load to Brightspace (Zoom can take a couple plus hours for this happen) and for you to watch the lecture But also for those attending live, some students may need some time for lectures to consolidate in their minds before theyre able to reflect on what they learned. Hopefully this extra time gives students the time they need How many of these do I have to do? One per lecture, but you can miss up to 2 and still get full credit. So you need to do 15 reflections for the 17 lectures. 1.5.4 Extra Credit: Research Participation (up to 2%) Many psychology studies are run at research universities and recruit undergraduates as participants. If you would like, you may participate in a research study for up to 2% extra credit on your final grade. You will earn 0.5% extra credit per half hour of research participation (i.e., 2 hours of participation for the full 2% extra credit). You can sign up for research experiments on Sona (http://nyu-psych.sonasystems.com), the psychology departments online experiment management system. To start signing up for studies, first request a Sona account at http://nyu-psych.sonasystems.com. Your login information will be sent to your NYU e-mail address within 24 hours. If you are under 18 years of age, please note that you will need a parent or guardian to sign a Parental Consent form prior to each study you complete. Please read the Advanced Psychology Student Guide for more details and step-by-step instructions for creating a Sona account and signing up for research studies. If you are under 18 years of age, please note that you will need a parent or guardian to sign a Parental Consent form prior to each study you complete. Any questions/concerns about the research requirement or Sona should be directed to the Subject Pool Administrator, Brenda Woodford-Febres (brenda.woodford@nyu.edu). The deadline for research participation is August 13th. If you are unable to participate in research participation and want another opportunity to earn this extra credit, please reach out by Monday, July 26th to coordinate an alternate assignment. 1.5.5 Grading It is each students responsibility to monitor their grades online and report any discrepancies to the grader within one week of the contested assignment. DO NOT wait until the end of the term to check your grade. The grading scale is as follows: A = 93 - 100 B = 83 - 86 C = 73 - 76 D = 63 - 66 A- = 90 - 92 B- = 80 - 82 C- = 70 - 72 D- = 60 - 62 B+ = 87 - 89 C+ = 77 - 79 D+ = 67 - 69 F &lt; 60 For questions about Exam or Participation grades, contact Kelsey. For questions about Research Report grades, contact Ben. 1.6 Schedule This is the schedule for the semester. This page will be frequently updated based on how we progress (plus Ill add links to extra readings and resources), and everything is subject to change. But this should give you a gist of the general topics that will be covered in this class. If there is something in particular you would like covered in this class (that falls within the purview of an intro stats course) and you do not see it on the syllabus, please reach out to me.

We only meet for 6 weeks (a total of 17 classes), and classes build cumulatively off each other. If you are unable to attend class, all lectures will be recorded and made available on NYU Brightspace. 1.7.2 Honor code and plagarism No form of academic dishonesty will be tolerated. Suspicions of academic dishonesty during exams or on writing assignments will be reported to and adjudicated by the Associate Dean for Students. If a case of academic dishonesty is confirmed, it will result in a penalty that is at least as severe as receiving a 0 on the assignment or quiz. Academic dishonesty includes all forms of plagiarism. Plagiarism includes (but is not limited to): copying or paraphrasing from someone elses work (another student, an online source, or a journal article), turning in someone elses work as your own, or presenting someone elses ideas (a student, online source, or scholar) as your own. Most importantly, cheating only really serves to cheat yourself out of a learning opportunity. There are many opportunities to make up for a less-than-ideal grade, so dont let the possibility of a bad grade tempt you to cheat. We will do our best to make clear the line between academic dishonesty and collaborative learning. But if you have any questions about where this line is, it is your responsibility to ask the instructor. 1.7.3 Accomodation Any student requesting academic accommodations needs to notify the instructor before the third day of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Students with disabilities should also contact Disability Support Services in the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities. 1.7.4 Extra Help If you start to struggle at any time during this course, please let us know as early as possible. We are happy to help and make accommodations (especially given the extraordinary circumstances!) but its a lot easier to do so early on than it is to change things after the fact. If you come to us at the end of the class there may be very little we can do. The University Learning Center has free peer tutoring and will be holding drop-in peer tutoring hours this summer, including weekly group session in support of statistics. Please see their website for their schedule. 1.7.5 Late Assignments Due to the condensed nature of this course, late assignments cannot be accepted. However, the nature of the grading for this course provides many opportunities to make up for missed assignments. You can miss up to 2 reflection papers and still receive full credit for participation. Similarly, only your highest final exam will count toward your grade. If you are unable to make an assignment deadline, please reach out to us before the assignment is due. However, if you are in the hospital with a serious illness, its okay to reach out after the deadline when you feel a bit better (yes, this has happened, and I promise you your health and well-being is more important than this class). 1.7.6 Religious observances Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance which conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me by the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations. 1.7.7 Pandemic and just the general nature of life We are all going through difficult times during the pandemic. These include changes in our normal ways of doing things, living arrangements, family responsibilities, concerns about health and wellbeing, etc None of us is really OK all the time. If you tell me youre having trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you but will work with you to come up with a pathway forward. I hope you can extend me and the TA the same grace. You never owe me personal information about your health. You are always welcome to talk to me about things that you are going through. If I cant help you I might be able to direct you to someone who can. If you need extra help or need to miss a class or need more time please just ask. I will try to work with you.
